Tree
==================

About the Tree:
full binary tree: A binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children.
Perfect binary tree: A binary tree with all leaf nodes at the same depth. All internal nodes have degree 2 [1]

The difference between Full Binary Tree & Complete Binary Tree:
(1). a binary tree T is full if each node is either a leaf or possesses exactly two child nodes.
(2). a binary tree T with n levels is complete if all levels except possibly the last are completely full, and the last level has all its 
nodes to the left side. [2]

AVL Trees: AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees. These trees are named after their two
inventors G.M. Adel’son-Vel’skii and E.M. Landis. [3]

The height/depth of a tree:
The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. 
The height of the root is the height of the tree. The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root path).
This is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, 
AVL Trees in particular. The root node has depth zero, leaf nodes have height zero, 
and a tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. 
Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such are allowed) has depth and height −1.[4]
